# Realtime chat application with sentiment analysis

## Technologies used:

* ReactJS
* NextJS server-side rendering framework
* PusherJS for realtime client-server communication
* Sentiment node module for performing sentiment analysis on user-input text


## Introduction
This is a very simple chat application I developed after having used React for several months, during which I'd read about NextJS, a very popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. Similarly to Facebook's Create-React-App starter environment, NextJS provides a no-configuration framework for building React applications quickly, whilst solving issues often faced when trying to build server-rendered applications, among other features.
